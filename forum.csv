The guy had a very fancy magnet, perhaps we should all get one... it's probably what the trade use. _________________If you tie a piece of buttered toast to a cat's back, then drop it off a high building. It will hover just above the ground rotating slowly."

I'm not sure I heard it right but I'm sure they said Jaguar invented IRS as drivers were finding it difficult to handle the car as it was so long?.

The restoration was a bodge and looked like it was done in twenty one days.

I agree,it was like an episode of Eastenders,a poor one even by their standards._________________Selling   imperial hand tools for old machinery."

Although the valuation seemed a little optimistic, I'm glad the fella from RM at least pointed out the hideous sunroof, change of colour, and it being auto and LHD as being some of the car's less attractive points.

And would anyone looking for a 2+2 really consider this one, assuming they had a clue about old cars? Perhaps if it came at the right price, and a prospective purchaser wanted to fit one with a period-correct Webasto roof, but otherwise ...?

Did they really believe anyone with the faintest interest in classic cars would find the program at all informative?.Maybe it was supposed to be a comedy._________________Selling   imperial hand tools for old machinery."

15,87247,norustplease," Thu Sep 27, 2012 8:13 pm ","Well, I couldn't resist it. After everyone's comments I had to go on line and watch it. It was so awful that I may watch the next one for a laugh.  My opinion of Adrian Flux as  sponsor has slipped, however. Would you as part of a serious car restoration industry want to be associated with this sort of thing?

I wondered why they wasted the first part of the programme with the odious Bernie insulting people on the phone and making rude comments about their cars and asking prices.The car 'as found' looked as if it had been decorated to appear rougher than it was, and the whole thing was vaguely reminiscent of the extremely stagey  'Pimp my Ride' series. No attempt to talk about what sort of state the underbody might be in and no attempt to derust the inside of the shell. The episode with the carbs, totally spurious. 

And as for the guy walloping the nosecone with a hammer.....pass the filler!
